# Prerequisites

To do any work with RK² (for example, to [publish site updates](./site.md), which needs little software development ability), you'll want the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - currently using version 12
- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- Git - on Windows, install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

On Mac, the easiest way to get all of these is to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). For example, `brew install node@12 yarn git`.

Several of the development scripts use Bash. On Mac, Bash is provided by the OS; on Windows, you can use Git Bash, which should be provided by Git for Windows.

For information on cloning the RK² repository and working with it, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
